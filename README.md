Theta is a realtime AI assistant with a browser chat UI. It consists of three Python services:

    operations — public API, authentication, chat history, WebSocket, and frontend
    agents — agent execution and streamed Responses-API output
    mcp — MCP tools and skill resources

Only operations should be exposed to users. agents and mcp communicate over the private Compose network.
Run with Docker Compose

Requirements: Docker Compose v2 and an OpenAI-compatible Responses WebSocket endpoint at /v1/responses.

cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and set LLM_API_KEY
docker compose up --build

Open http://127.0.0.1. Operations listens on port 80 and serves the UI, API, WebSocket chat, and /mcp/ endpoint from the same ASGI application. SQLite is stored in the named volume operations-data.

docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f operations agents
docker compose down                 # preserve the database
docker compose down -v              # also delete the database

The LLM URL must include ws:// or wss://, for example ws://host.docker.internal:4000/v1.
Local development

python3.14 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Start AgentsExecution and Operations in separate terminals. Operations also serves the MCP endpoint:

cd AgentsExecution && MCP_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090/mcp/ uvicorn main:app --reload --port 6000
cd Operations && PYTHONPATH=.. uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8090

AWS deployment without a registry

Use an EC2 Linux instance with Docker Engine, Compose v2, Git, and a TLS certificate or load balancer for HTTPS. Clone the repository once:

sudo mkdir -p /opt/theta
sudo chown "$USER":"$USER" /opt/theta
git clone <repository-url> /opt/theta
cd /opt/theta
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and set LLM_API_KEY

Build locally on the instance. Worker counts are configured in .env:

docker compose up -d --build --remove-orphans
docker compose ps
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1/health

No image registry is required. The default configuration starts 4 Uvicorn worker processes for Agents and 1 for Operations. Each worker has a maximum of 16 concurrent requests and recycles after 1,000 requests. Four Agents workers with a pool of four LLM links each gives up to 16 LLM WebSocket links total.

Operations currently uses process-local active chat state. A reconnect or follow-up request can land in a different worker and lose the in-memory stream. Before increasing OPERATIONS_WORKERS, move run coordination, event buffering, and MCP session state to shared services such as Redis, and use PostgreSQL for shared persistence. The request and 1,000-request recycle limits still apply independently to every worker.

The public entrypoint is port 80. Operations serves /mcp/ directly through the mounted FastMCP ASGI app. Operations defaults to one worker because FastMCP Streamable HTTP sessions are process-local; externalize MCP session state before increasing OPERATIONS_WORKERS. Do not expose ports 5000, 6000, or 8090 publicly. Put HTTPS in front of Operations for production and back up the operations-data volume.
Health checks

    Operations: GET /health (also checks Agents)
    Agents: GET /health (reports loaded tools and skills)
    MCP: mounted at /mcp/ inside Operations
